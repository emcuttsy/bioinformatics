This repository contains all of the various scripts, jupyter notebooks, functions, and other snippets of code I write for my research. Mostly glorified text-parsing, but hey that's fun!

The **jupyter-notebooks** directory contains jupyter notebooks. Many of these run modules on the MIT eofe7 cluster.

The **sbatch-scripts** directory contains shell scripts for submission via `sbatch` to the SLURM workload manager on MIT's eofe7 cluster.  

The **scripts** directory contains python scripts.

Sometimes I clean up my code and add comments to make it "safe" for use by others. For now, **"clean"  and commented notebooks and scripts are kept in the root directory**. My "dirty" code is hidden away in the subdirectoriesâ€”you're free to use it, but do so understanding that it was never intended to be seen by anyone but me. I'm figuring all this stuff out as I go so there are no guarantees that any of this takes the best/most efficient/most programmer-ly approach.
